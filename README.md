# Hovse Ov Bones Enchiridion

A collection of all the house rules & hacks for [*Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition*](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document).

<!---
## Core Assumptions

1. The world is generally a grimdark place overall, but individuals and events can—and often do—defy this expectation.
2. The world is magical, but magic use by mortals is relatively rare, for spells are sometimes unreliable and often unpredictable.
3. The maximum level is 10.

## Rule Changes and Variants

### Character Options

#### Lucky Signs
Characters gain a [lucky sign](<Character Options/Lucky Signs.md>) during character creation.

#### Inventory
Carrying capacity is determined using a [slot based inventory](<Character Options/Inventory.md>) instead of weight.

#### Additional Subclasses
Additional subclasses are available.
- [Chronomancer](<Character Options/Subclasses/Chronomancer.md>)
- [Knight-Sorcerer](<Character Options/Subclasses/Knight-Sorcerer.md>)
- [Oath of the Right Hand Path](<Character Options/Subclasses/Oath of the Right Hand Path.md>)
- [Templar](<Character Options/Subclasses/Templar.md>)

### Combat
[Initiative](Combat/Initiative.md) is rolled as a group.

Critical hits and injuries have the potential to be more debilitating.
- [Critical Hits](<Combat/Critical Hits.md>)
- [Lingering Injuries](<Combat/Lingering Injuries.md>)

### Magic
Non-ritual spells can trigger misfires. Most magical healing options have been condensed.
- [Spellcasting](Magic/Spellcasting.md)
    - [Misfires](Magic/Misfire.md)
- [Healing](Magic/Healing.md)




<!---
#### Tendency

Alignment has been removed and replaced with Tendency. Tendency ranges from Cloudy to Clear, expressed as a number ranging from zero to ten. A character’s tendency is determined by their actions. Generally speaking, truthful and selfless actions shift a character’s tendency towards Clear, while deceitful or selfish actions shift it towards Cloudy.

- Cloudy: 0-3
- Neutral: 4-6
- Clear: 7-10

#### Luck

In addition to the six standard ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—you have a Luck score. Luck measures your ability to defy the odds. Be it karma, divine favor, or simple chance, luck is a fickle thing.

## Luck in Play

**Luck Checks and Saving Throws.** Luck may be used for a skill check or saving throw at the DM’s discretion, or when none of scores apply.

[**Instant Near-Death**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#InstantDeath)**.** When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum plus your Luck modifier.

**Critical Hits and Automatic Misses.** Higher luck increases the odds that a successful hit will be a [critical hit](craftdocs://open?blockId=E36AAAF1-29E1-42E2-B114-0307CF104F6F&spaceId=a523060b-b484-2be9-13c0-9910aedf6f51). Low luck increases the chance you will miss.

### Luck Modifier Effects

- \-1, automatically miss on rolls of 2 or lower
- 0, no change
- 1, on an attack roll of 19 that hits the target, a critical hit is triggered
- 2, on an attack roll of 18 or 19 that hits the target, a critical hit is triggered
- 3, on an attack roll of 17–19 that hits the target, a critical hit is triggered
- 4, on an attack roll of 16–19 that hits the target, a critical hit is triggered
- 5, on an attack roll of 15–19 that hits the target, a critical hit is triggered

## Determining Ability Scores

If rolling for ability scores, simply roll seven times total. If using the standard array, simply add an additional score of 12, for an array of: 15, 14, 13, 12, 12, 10, 8. If using point buy, use a total of 32 points to spend on ability scores.

#### Original Variant

In addition to the six standard ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—you have a Luck score. Luck measures your ability to defy the odds. Be it karma, divine favor, or simple chance, luck is a fickle thing.

## Luck in Play

There are no skills or checks associated with Luck. Instead, the DM may determine that the situation dictates that you should add your Luck modifier to another roll. Also, you can tempt fate by spending Luck Points.

### Luck Points

- You have a maximum number of luck points equal to your Luck modifier.
- You may spend one luck point to reroll any roll that you make, except rolls made to regain luck points.
- At the conclusion of a long rest, you may roll 1d4. If the result is equal to or less than your current amount of luck points, regain one luck point.

## Determining Ability Scores

If rolling for ability scores, simply roll seven times total. If using the standard array, simply add an additional score of 12, for an array of: 15, 14, 13, 12, 12, 10, 8. If using point buy, use a total of 32 points to spend on ability scores.
