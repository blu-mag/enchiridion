# Hovse Ov Bones Enchiridion

A collection of house rules & hacks for [*Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition*](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document).

<!---
## Core Assumptions

1. The world is generally a grimdark place overall, but individuals and events can—and often do—defy this expectation.
2. The world is magical, but magic use by mortals is relatively rare, for spells are sometimes unreliable and often unpredictable.
3. The maximum level is 10.
