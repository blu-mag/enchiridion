# Spellcasting

Any character that can cast a spell has a spell die. The spell die starts as a d10. It can have its size increased or decreased along the following scale: d10 ↔ d8 ↔ d6 ↔ d4.

When a non-ritual spell is cast, roll the spell die against a DC equal to 1 + the level of the spell being cast. You can increase the result by concentrating on the spell before you cast it. For each round spent concentrating this way, add 1 to your result. Follow concentration rules as normal. If you lose concentration, the spellcasting fails and the spell slot is consumed.

On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, roll on the [misfire table](Misfires.md). On a result of 1, reduce the size of spell die by one step.

Increase the size of the spell die by one step whenever you complete a long rest.
