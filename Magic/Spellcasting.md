# Spellcasting

Any character that can cast a spell has a spell die. The spell die starts as a d10. Its size can increase or decrease along the following scale: d10 ↔ d8 ↔ d6 ↔ d4.

When a non-ritual spell is cast, roll the spell die against a DC equal to the level of the spell being cast. You can increase the result by using your action to concentrate on the spell before you cast it. For each round spent concentrating this way, add 1 to your result. Follow concentration rules as normal. If you lose concentration, the spellcasting fails and the spell slot is consumed.

On a success, the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, the spell is cast, but you must roll on the [misfire table](</Magic/Misfires.md>). On a result of 1, reduce the size of spell die by one step.

Increase the size of the spell die by one step whenever you complete a long rest.
