# Spellcasting

Any character that can cast a spell has a spell die. The spell die starts as a d10. Its size can increase or decrease along the following scale: d10 ↔ d8 ↔ d6 ↔ d4.

When you cast a non-ritual spell, roll the spell die. If the result is greater than the level of the spell being cast (or 1 if casting a cantrip), the spell casts as normal. Otherwise, in addition to the spell's normal effect, roll on the [misfire table](</Magic/Misfires.md>) to determine any other effects. On a result of 1, reduce the size of spell die by one step.

You can increase the result by using your action to concentrate on the spell before you cast it. For each round spent concentrating this way, add 1 to your result. Follow concentration rules as normal. If you lose concentration, the spellcasting fails and the spell slot is consumed.

Increase the size of the spell die by one step whenever you complete a long rest.
