You excite the magickal energies around a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal and extra 1d4 force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack. Also, when you roll maximum damage, you restore one first level spell slot. You can only restore one spell slot per turn this way.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to target a new creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage die increases by one step for each slot level above 1st.
