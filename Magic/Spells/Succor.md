# Succor

*1st Level Evocation*

> **Activation:** 1 Action
>
> **Range/Area:** Touch
>
> **Target:** A creature you touch
>
> **Components:** S
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to a number of rolled hit dice equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, plus your spellcasting modifier.

The damage healed varies according these factors:

-   It is always a number of dice of the same type as the target’s hit die. For example, a fighter has a d10 hit die, so she would be healed with d10 dice.
    -   If healing a multi classed target, start with the largest hit die and work your way down.
-   The number of dice healed cannot exceed the target’s total number of hit dice.
-   Before casting the spell, the caster can opt to attempt to heal or remove a specific condition instead, listed below. In this case, the target’s maximum hit dice do not act as a ceiling. Overflow dice do not become healing.
    -   Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned: 2 dice
    -   Disease: 3 dice
    -   Broken limb: 4 dice
    -   Charmed, Petrified, Cursed: 5 dice
    -   Other conditions at the DM’s discretion

The caster may not heal undead, animated objects, extraplanar creatures, or constructs.

##### Succor Healing Table

A cleric’s [[Tendency|tendency]] affects the results, as referenced on the table below. *Same* indicates the same tendency, *adjacent* indicates tendency one step away, and *opposed* indicates opposite tendencies. A druid’s tendency does not affect the results, and they always use the *adjacent* result.

This is the original table, which has the ‘middle’ row being the most common of the success rows

|  d20  | Same   | Adjacent | Opposed |
| :---: | ------ | -------- | ------- |
|  1-11 | 1 HP   | 1 HP     | 1 HP    |
| 12-13 | 2 dice | 1 die    | 1 die   |
| 14-19 | 3 dice | 2 dice   | 1 die   |
| 20-21 | 4 dice | 3 dice   | 2 dice  |
|  22+  | 5 dice | 4 dice   | 3 dice  |

The table below tightens the scale and makes it slightly easier to get the ‘best’ result’

|  d20  | Same   | Adjacent | Opposed |

|  1-11 | 1 HP   | 1 HP     | 1 HP    |
