# Initiative

A variant on side initiative that doesn't make individual initiative rolls irrelevant.

When rolling for initiative, each group participating sums the highest and lowest roll among the group, and uses the total as their group’s initiative score.

When it’s a groups’s turn, the members of that group can act in any order they choose. Once everyone in the group has taken a turn, the other group goes. A round ends when both groups have completed their turns.

If more than two groups take part in a battle, each group rolls for initiative. Groups act from the highest roll to lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the battle is complete.
