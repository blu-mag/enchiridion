# Lingering Injuries

Damage normally leaves no lingering effects, but a creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circumstances:

- When it takes a critical hit
- When it drops to 0 hit points but isn’t killed outright
- When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries Table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.

|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | ***Lose an Eye.*** You have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you’re [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded).                                                            |
| 2     | ***Lose an Arm or a Hand.*** You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3     | ***Lose a Foot or Leg.*** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) after using the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash) action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance.                       |
| 4     | ***Limp.*** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the [Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Dash) action. If you fail the save, you fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). Magical healing can remove the limp.                                                                     |
| 5–7   | ***Internal Injury.*** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can’t use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.                                                                                                                   |
| 8–10  | ***Broken Ribs.*** This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11–13 | ***Horrible Scar.*** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can’t be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Persuasion)) checks and advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation)) checks. Magical healing can remove the scar.        |
| 14–16 | ***Festering Wound.*** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Medicine)) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 17-20 | ***Minor Scar.*** The scar doesn’t have any adverse effect. Magical healing can remove the scar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
