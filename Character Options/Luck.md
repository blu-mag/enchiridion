#### Luck

In addition to the six standard ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—you have a Luck score. Luck measures your ability to defy the odds. Be it karma, divine favor, or simple chance, luck is a fickle thing.

## Luck in Play

**Luck Checks and Saving Throws.** Luck may be used for a skill check or saving throw at the DM’s discretion, or when none of scores apply.

**Critical Hits and Automatic Misses.** Higher luck increases the odds that a successful hit will be a [critical hit](craftdocs://open?blockId=E36AAAF1-29E1-42E2-B114-0307CF104F6F&spaceId=a523060b-b484-2be9-13c0-9910aedf6f51). Low luck increases the chance you will miss.

## Luck in Play

There are no skills or checks associated with Luck. Instead, the DM may determine that the situation dictates that you should add your Luck modifier to another roll. Also, you can tempt fate by spending Luck Points.

### Luck Points

- You have a maximum number of luck points equal to your Luck modifier.
- You may spend one luck point to reroll any roll that you make, except rolls made to regain luck points.
- At the conclusion of a long rest, you may roll 1d4. If the result is equal to or less than your current amount of luck points, regain one luck point.
