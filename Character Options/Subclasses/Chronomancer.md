#### Time Savant

*2nd-level Chronomancer feature*

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you do not require any time to copy a spell into your spellbook, since you finish before you started.

#### Flip the Hourglass

*2nd-level Chronomancer feature*

When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you starts its turn, you can use your reaction to immediately take your turn.

#### Recall

*6th-level Chronomancer feature*

As an action, you can magically force a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature’s current place in time in marked for up to one hour while you maintain concentration. You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to extend the effect. The effect ends early if you use your bonus action to do anything else. When the effect ends, the target’s exact state when it was marked is restored, including: location, hit point value, any conditions affecting it, number of spell slots and hit dice expended, and exhaustion levels.

#### Displace Debility

*10th-level Chronomancer feature*

When you take damage or gain a condition, you can choose to take half the damage now, and half the damage at the start of your next turn. Any conditions you would gain you can choose to gain at the start of your next turn instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when completing a long rest.

#### Double Time

*14th-level Chronomancer feature*

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can attempt to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

Make an Intelligence ability check. The DC is equal to:

$15 + Spell Level + Cumulative Uses Since Long Rest$

On a success, the casting time is changed to 1 bonus action. On a failure, the spell misfires, consuming a spell slot but otherwise having no effect and, is no longer prepared and must be prepared before being cast again.

The DC increases by 1 each time this feature is used, resetting after a long rest.
