#### Templar Lore

*3rd-level Templar feature*

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the **Religion** skill, and you learn the **thaumaturgy** cantrip.

#### Edicts

*3rd-level Templar feature*

At 3rd level, you learn to issue edicts, special recitations with magical effects. When you gain this feature, you learn two Edicts of your choice (see “Edict Options” below).

Each Edict has two versions: Major and Minor. You can issue one of each version. Major Edicts typically offer enhanced effects, at an increased cost. Once a Major Edict has been issued, neither Minor or Major versions of that same edict may be issued until after a long rest. When you complete a short rest, you regain the use of Minor Edicts whose Major version has not been issued.

An Edict’s effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn, and requires a bonus action to activate, unless otherwise stated.

You gain additional Edicts of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

##### Edict Options

Edicts fall into two categories: Blessings, for beneficial effects; and Censures, for debilitating effects. In order to be affected by an Edict, a creature must be able to hear you. Unless otherwise specified, an Edict affects a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Edicts take effect immediately on willing targets. If a target is unwilling, it can make a saving throw to resist its effect. If an option requires a saving throw, your Edict save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

#### Blessings

Assault:
Minor: Targets can make a weapon attack as a bonus action.
Major: As above, and all weapon attacks have advantage.

Freedom:
Minor: Targets are unaffected by difficult terrain.
Major: As above, and grants immunity to the restrained condition. Target can use their reaction to move up to their movement without provoking opportunity attacks.

Protection:
Minor: Choose one target. That target gains resistance to all damage.
Major: Reaction, which you take when you see a creature taking damage. The target gains immunity to all damage.

#### Censures

Chains:
Minor: Targets are restrained.
Major: As above, and choose one of the targets. That target is paralyzed.

Rebuke:
Minor: Reaction, which you take when you see a creature casting a spell or making a weapon attack. If the creature fails its saving throw, their spell or attack fails and has no effect.
Major: As above, and the target is stunned.

Sundering:
Minor: Choose one target. Attacks against creature have advantage.
Major: Affects a number of targets up to your Wisdom modifier.

Wrath:
Minor: Choose one target. It has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Major: Affects a number of targets up to your Wisdom modifier.

#### Empowered Edicts

*7th-level Templar feature*

At 7th level, your edicts confer additional benefit or ruin to those affected by them.

Targets affected by one of your Blessings recover additional HP equal to your Wisdom modifier when restoring HP.

Targets affected by one of your Censures take an additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier when taking damage.

#### Everlasting Edicts

*15th-level Templar feature*

Starting at 15th level, your Edicts are available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no major edicts remaining, choose one: you regain one minor use of it.
