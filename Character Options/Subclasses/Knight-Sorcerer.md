#### Arcane Charges

*1st-level Knight-Sorcerer feature*

At level 1, you capture the energy of some of the spells you cast. Each time you cast a spell of level 1 or higher, you accumulate a number of Arcane Charges equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.

You can store a maximum number of Arcane Charges equal to half your level in this class, minimum of one, and you lose all charges when completing a long rest.

#### Arcane Blades

*1st-level Knight-Sorcerer feature*

Also at level 1, you learn the cantrip ***[Arcane Blades](</Magic/Spells/Arcane Blades.md>)***, which does not count against your spells known:

#### Barrier

*6th-level Knight-Sorcerer feature*

At 6th level, you learn to use stored magical energy for defense as well as offense. When you cast Arcane Blades and expend Arcane Charges, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number of charges expended, plus your Charisma Modifier.

#### Fade Step

*14th-level Knight-Sorcerer feature*

Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to expend a sorcery point and step into the Ethereal Plane until the start of your next turn. You can return to your originating plane at any time (no action required). While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so. If you return to the material plane in a space occupied by a creature, that creature takes damage equal to your level in this class, and you are shunted to the nearest open space within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Arcane Detonation

*18th-level Knight-Sorcerer feature*

At 18th level, you can detonate the energy that lingers and fuels magical effects. When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature that is already under the effect of another spell cast by you, you can combine their magic into a destructive explosion. Roll a number of d6 equal to the level of the spell with the ongoing effect, and add the total to the damage of the new spell. The ongoing spell immediately ends.
