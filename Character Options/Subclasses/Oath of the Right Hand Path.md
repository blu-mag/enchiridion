#### Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

***Form Coven.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to form a special bond with others, called a coven. As an action, you can imbue a number of tokens up to your Charisma modifier (minimum one) with magicks. Whoever holds these trinkets become part of your coven, gaining the features below. A creature must be holding the token to gain the benefits. You are automatically part of any coven you create.

- Members of the coven on the same plane of existence can communicate telepathically with each other.
- Members of the coven always know where the other members are.
- Members of the coven can share their knowledge. Each member can choose one language, skill, or tool they are proficient with, and share this proficiency with the other members, who are considered proficient in the shared discipline. Expertise can also be shared, but sharing proficiency to a character already proficient in a given discipline does not grant expertise.

%%- When any member of the coven makes an ability check or saving throw, another member of the coven can silently perform the Help action using their reaction, as long as they can see the member making the ability check or saving throw.%%

You can only have one coven at a time, and the magicks imbued in the tokens fades after a long rest. A coven breaks if any of its members dies.

***Assume.*** You can cast the ***[alter self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/alter-self)*** spell, using the “Change Appearance” option, without requiring any components or needing to maintain concentration.

#### Aura of the Right Hand Path

Starting at 7th level, your connection to the weave strengthens, allowing for others nearby to benefit from sympathetic magicks. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Allied creatures within the aura can cast a spell that you have prepared. Spellcasters cast the spell using their own spell slots, spell casting ability modifier, and spell save DC. Non-spellcasters instead use your spell slots and spell save DC.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Strengthened Bond

%%Starting at 15th level, the magicks that bind your covens together grow stronger. Whenever a member of the coven takes damage, they can choose use their reaction to instead take half damage, with the remaining damage split equally between the other members of the coven.%%

- [ ] `should probably think of a feature that doesn't require specific channel divinity use or separate coven creation from channel divinity`

#### Capstone

- [ ] Incomplete
